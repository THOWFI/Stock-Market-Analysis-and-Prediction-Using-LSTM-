# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data and building a predictive model for stock closing prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Overview

This repository contains code and analysis for a stock market project, originally based on a Kaggle notebook ([Stock Market Analysis & Prediction using LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faressayah/stock-market-analysis-prediction-using-lstm)). The project aims to:

* **Acquire and Preprocess Data:** Reliably download historical stock data and prepare it for time-series analysis.
* **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize stock market trends, including closing price fluctuations, moving averages, and daily returns.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Identify relationships between different stock variables.
* **LSTM Modeling:** Build a predictive model for stock closing prices using LSTM networks.
* **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate and interpret the risk associated with stock investments.

## Key Features

* **Data Acquisition:** Utilizes `yfinance` to download historical stock data.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and transforms data for time-series analysis.
* **Visualization:** Generates informative plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
* **LSTM Model:** Implements an LSTM network using `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for stock price prediction.
* **Risk Analysis:** Calculates and visualizes stock risk.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow/Keras
* yfinance

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (Create a `requirements.txt` file with the list of dependencies if needed. You can create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)

3.  **Run the notebook:**

    Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file to execute the analysis and prediction.

## Usage

* Modify the stock tickers and date ranges to analyze different stocks.
* Experiment with different LSTM model architectures and hyperparameters.
* Adapt the risk analysis section to suit your specific risk assessment needs.
